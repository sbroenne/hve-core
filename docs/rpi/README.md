The RPI (Research, Plan, Implement) workflow transforms complex coding tasks into working solutions through three structured phases. Think of it as a type transformation pipeline:

> Uncertainty → Knowledge → Strategy → Working Code

## Why Use RPI?

AI coding assistants are brilliant at simple tasks and break everything they touch on complex ones. The root cause: AI can't tell the difference between investigating and implementing. When you ask for code, it writes code. It doesn't stop to verify that patterns match your existing modules or that the APIs it's calling actually exist.

RPI solves this through a counterintuitive insight: when AI knows it cannot implement, it stops optimizing for "plausible code" and starts optimizing for "verified truth." The constraint changes the goal.

**Key benefits:**

* 🔍 **Pattern matching**: uses verified existing patterns instead of inventing plausible ones.
* 📋 **Traceability**: every decision traced to specific files and line numbers.
* 🔄 **Knowledge transfer**: research documents anyone can follow, not tribal knowledge.

RPI separates concerns into distinct phases, each with its own specialized custom agent.

## The Three Phases

### 🔍 Research Phase (Task Researcher)

**Purpose:** Transform uncertainty into verified knowledge

* Investigates codebase, external APIs, and documentation
* Documents findings with evidence and sources
* Creates ONE recommended approach per scenario
* **Output:** `YYYYMMDD-<topic>-research.md`

### 📋 Plan Phase (Task Planner)

**Purpose:** Transform knowledge into actionable strategy

* Creates coordinated planning files with checkboxes and details
* Includes line number references for precision
* Validates research exists before proceeding
* **Output:** Plan, details, and implementation prompt files

### ⚡ Implement Phase (Task Implementor)

**Purpose:** Transform strategy into working code

* Executes plan task by task with verification
* Tracks all changes in a changes log
* Supports stop controls for review
* **Output:** Working code + `YYYYMMDD-<topic>-changes.md`

## The Critical Rule: Clear Context Between Phases

🔴 **Always use `/clear` or start a new chat between phases.**

Each custom agent has different instructions. Accumulated context causes confusion:

```text
Task Researcher → /clear → Task Planner → /clear → Task Implementor
```

Research findings are preserved in files, not chat history. Clean context lets each mode work optimally.

## When to Use RPI

| Use RPI When...                | Use Quick Edits When... |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Changes span multiple files    | Fixing a typo           |
| Learning new patterns/APIs     | Adding a log statement  |
| External dependencies involved | Refactoring < 50 lines  |
| Requirements are unclear       | Change is obvious       |

**Rule of Thumb:** If you need to understand something before implementing, use RPI.

## Quick Start

1. **Define the problem** clearly
2. **Research** using `/task-research <topic>` (automatically switches to Task Researcher)
3. **Clear context** with `/clear`
4. **Plan** using `/task-plan` (automatically switches to Task Planner)
5. **Clear context** with `/clear`
6. **Implement** using `/task-implement` (automatically switches to Task Implementor)

> [!TIP]
> The `/task-research`, `/task-plan`, and `/task-implement` prompts automatically switch to their respective custom agents, so you don't need to manually select them.

This guide shows you how to configure your project to use HVE Core's GitHub Copilot customizations (chat modes, instructions, and prompts).

## Prerequisites

* VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension installed
* Both repositories cloned as siblings on your machine

## Directory Structure

Clone both repositories side-by-side:

```text
repos/
├── my-project/
└── hve-core/
```

```bash
cd repos
git clone https://github.com/your-org/my-project.git
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core.git
```

```powershell
cd repos
git clone https://github.com/your-org/my-project.git
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core.git
```

## Workspace Configuration

Add these settings to your project's `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "chat.promptFilesLocations": {
    "../hve-core/.github/prompts": true
  },
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": {
    "../hve-core/.github/instructions": true
  },
  "chat.modeFilesLocations": {
    "../hve-core/.github/chatmodes": true
  }
}
```

This tells GitHub Copilot to discover customizations from the hve-core repository.

## Development Container Setup

If using dev containers, add this mount to your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
{
  "mounts": [
    "source=${localWorkspaceFolder}/../hve-core,target=/workspaces/hve-core,type=bind,consistency=cached"
  ]
}
```

After updating, rebuild the container:

* Press `F1` and select **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container**
* Or run: **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** from the Command Palette

## Verifying Setup

Check that everything works:

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat view (Ctrl+Alt+I)
2. Click the **agent picker dropdown** at the top of the chat panel
3. Verify custom agents from hve-core appear in the list:
   * task-planner
   * task-researcher
   * prompt-builder
   * pr-review
4. Select an agent and submit a test prompt

**Troubleshooting:** If custom agents don't appear, verify the `chat.modeFilesLocations` setting points to the correct path in your workspace settings.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Copilot not discovering hve-core customizations

**Solution:** Ensure you opened the `.code-workspace` file, not just the folder. The window title should show the workspace name, and both folders should appear in Explorer.

## Next Steps

* Explore [Chat Modes](../.github/chatmodes/README.md) for available agents
* Review [Instructions](../.github/instructions/README.md) for coding guidelines
* Check the [README](../README.md) for feature overview

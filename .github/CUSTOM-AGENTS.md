Specialized GitHub Copilot behaviors for common development workflows. Each custom agent is optimized for specific tasks with custom instructions and context.

## Quick Start

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat view (Ctrl+Alt+I or Cmd+Alt+I)
2. Click the **agent picker dropdown** at the top of the chat panel
3. Select the desired agent from the list
4. Enter your request and press Enter

**Example:**

* Select "task-planner" from the dropdown
* Type: "Create a plan to add Docker SHA validation"
* Press Enter

**Requirements:** GitHub Copilot subscription, VS Code with Copilot extension, proper workspace configuration (see [Getting Started](../docs/getting-started/README.md))

## Available Agents

## Agent Details

### rpi-agent

**Creates:** Subagent research artifacts when needed:

* `.copilot-tracking/subagent/YYYY-MM-DD/topic-research.md`

**Workflow:** Understand → Implement → Verify → Continue or Complete

**Critical:** Requires `runSubagent` tool enabled. Delegates MCP tools, heavy terminal commands, and complex research to subagents. Provides autonomous execution with loop guard for detecting stuck states.

### task-researcher

**Creates:** Single authoritative research document:

* `.copilot-tracking/research/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-topic-research.md`
* `.copilot-tracking/subagent/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}/task-research.md`

**Workflow:** Deep tool-based research → Document findings → Consolidate to one approach → Hand off to planner

**Critical:** Research-only specialist. Uses `runSubagent` tool. Continuously refines document. Never plans or implements.

### task-planner

**Creates:** Two interconnected files per task:

* `.copilot-tracking/plans/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-task-plan.instructions.md`
* `.copilot-tracking/details/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-task-details.md`

**Workflow:** Validates research → Creates plan files → User implements separately

**Critical:** Automatically calls task-researcher if research is missing. Treats all user input as planning requests. Never implements actual code.

### task-implementor

**Creates:** Change tracking logs:

* `.copilot-tracking/changes/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-task-changes.md`

**Workflow:** Analyze plan → Dispatch subagents per phase → Track progress → Validate

**Critical:** Requires completed plan files. Uses subagent architecture for parallel phase execution. Updates tracking artifacts after each phase.

### task-reviewer

**Creates:** Review validation logs:

* `.copilot-tracking/reviews/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}-<topic>-review.md`

**Workflow:** Locate artifacts → Extract checklist → Validate items → Run commands → Document findings

**Critical:** Review-only specialist. Validates against documentation, not assumptions. Produces findings with severity levels (Critical, Major, Minor).

**Documentation:** See [Task Reviewer Guide](../docs/rpi/task-reviewer.md) for detailed usage.

### prompt-builder

**Creates:** Instruction files and prompt files:

* `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`

## Common Workflows

### Autonomous Task Completion

1. Select **rpi-agent** from agent picker
2. Provide your request
3. Agent autonomously researches, implements, and verifies
4. Review results; agent continues if more work remains
5. Requires `runSubagent` tool enabled in settings

### Planning a Feature

1. Select **task-researcher** from agent picker and create research document
2. Review research and provide decisions on approach
3. Clear context or start new chat
4. Select **task-planner** from agent picker and attach research doc
5. Generate 3-file plan set
6. Use `/task-implement` to execute the plan (automatically switches to **task-implementor**)

### Code Review

1. Select **pr-review** from agent picker
2. Automatically runs 4-phase protocol
3. Collaborate during Phase 3 (review items)
4. Receive `handoff.md` with final PR comments

### Creating Instructions

1. Select **prompt-builder** from agent picker
2. Draft instruction file with conventions
3. Auto-validates with Prompt Tester persona
4. Iterates up to 3 times for quality
5. Delivered to `.github/instructions/`

### Creating Documentation

1. Select **prd-builder** or **brd-builder** from agent picker
2. Answer guided questions about the product or business initiative
3. Provide references and supporting materials
4. Review and refine iteratively
5. Finalize when quality gates pass

## Important Notes

* **Linting Exemption:** Files in `.copilot-tracking/**` are exempt from repository linting rules
* **Agent Switching:** Clear context or start a new chat when switching between specialized agents
* **Research First:** Task planner requires completed research; will automatically invoke researcher if missing
* **No Implementation:** Task planner and researcher never implement actual project code—they create planning artifacts only
* **Subagent Requirements:** Several agents require the `runSubagent` tool enabled in Copilot settings

## Tips

* Be specific in your requests for better results
* Provide context about what you're working on
* Review generated outputs before using
* Chain agents together for complex tasks
* Use the RPI workflow (Researcher → Planner → Implementor) for substantial features

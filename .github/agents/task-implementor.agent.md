# Implementation Plan Executor

Executes implementation plan instructions located in `.copilot-tracking/plans/**` by dispatching subagents for each phase. Progress is tracked in matching change logs at `.copilot-tracking/changes/**`.

## Subagent Architecture

Use the `runSubagent` tool to dispatch one subagent per implementation plan phase. Each subagent:

* Reads its assigned phase section from the implementation plan, details, and research files.
* Implements all steps within that phase, updating the codebase and files.
* Completes each checkbox item in the plan for its assigned phase.
* Returns a structured completion report for the main agent to update tracking artifacts.

When `runSubagent` is unavailable, follow the phase implementation instructions directly.

### Parallel Execution

When the implementation plan indicates phases can be parallelized (marked with `parallel: true` or similar notation), dispatch multiple subagents simultaneously. Otherwise, execute phases sequentially.

### Subagent Response Format

Subagents return:

* Phase identifier and completion status.
* Steps completed with brief descriptions.
* Files added, modified, or removed.
* Validation results or errors.
* Clarification requests when context is insufficient.

### Inline Research

When subagents need additional context, use these tools: `semantic_search`, `grep_search`, `read_file`, `list_dir`, `fetch_webpage`, `github_repo`, and MCP documentation tools. Write findings to `.copilot-tracking/subagent/YYYYMMDD/<topic>-research.md`.

## Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Path Pattern | Required |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Implementation Plan | `.copilot-tracking/plans/<date>-<description>-plan.instructions.md` | Yes |
| Implementation Details | `.copilot-tracking/details/<date>-<description>-details.md` | Yes |
| Research | `.copilot-tracking/research/<date>-<description>-research.md` | No |
| Changes Log | `.copilot-tracking/changes/<date>-<description>-changes.md` | Yes |

Reference relevant guidance in `.github/instructions/**` before editing code. Dispatch subagents for inline research when context is missing.

## Preparation

Review the implementation plan header, overview, and checklist structure to understand phases, steps, and dependencies. Identify which phases can run in parallel based on plan annotations. Inspect the existing changes log to confirm current status.

## Required Phases

### Phase 1: Plan Analysis

Read the implementation plan to identify all implementation phases. For each phase, note:

* Phase identifier and description.
* Line ranges for corresponding details and research sections.
* Dependencies on other phases.
* Whether the phase supports parallel execution.

Proceed to Phase 2 when all phases are cataloged.

### Phase 2: Subagent Dispatch

Use `runSubagent` to dispatch implementation subagents. For each implementation plan phase, provide:

* Phase identifier and step list from the plan.
* Line ranges for details and context references.
* Instruction files to follow from `.github/instructions/**`.
* Expected response format.

Dispatch phases in parallel when the plan indicates parallel execution is supported.

Subagent completion report structure:

```markdown
## Phase Completion: {{phase-id}}

**Status**: {{complete|partial|blocked}}

### Steps Completed

* [ ] or [x] {{step-name}} - {{brief outcome}}

### Files Changed

**Added**: {{paths}}
**Modified**: {{paths}}
**Removed**: {{paths}}

### Validation Results

{{lint, test, or build outcomes}}

### Clarification Needed

{{questions for user, or "None"}}
```

When a subagent returns clarification requests, pause and present questions to the user. Resume dispatch after receiving answers.

### Phase 3: Tracking Updates

After subagents complete, update tracking artifacts directly (without subagents):

* Mark completed steps as `[x]` in the implementation plan instructions.
* Append file changes to the changes log under **Added**, **Modified**, or **Removed**.
* Record any deviations or follow-ups in the implementation details file.

### Phase 4: User Handoff

When pausing or completing implementation, provide the user:

* Summary of phases and steps completed.
* Any outstanding clarification requests or blockers.
* Commit message in a markdown code block following commit-message.instructions.md when changes were made. Exclude files in `.copilot-tracking` from the commit message.

### Phase 5: Completion Checks

Implementation is complete when:

* Every phase and step is marked `[x]` with aligned change log updates.
* All referenced files compile, lint, and test successfully.
* The changes log includes a Release Summary after the final phase.

## Implementation Standards

Every implementation produces self-sufficient, working code aligned with implementation details. Follow exact file paths, schemas, and instruction documents cited in the implementation details and research references. Keep the changes log synchronized with step progress.

Code quality:

* Mirror existing patterns for architecture, data flow, and naming.
* Avoid partial implementations that leave completed steps in an indeterminate state.
* Run required validation commands relevant to the artifacts modified.
* Document complex logic with concise comments only when necessary.

Constraints: Implement only what the implementation details specify. Avoid creating tests, scripts, markdown documents, backwards compatibility layers, or non-standard documentation unless explicitly requested. Review existing tests and scripts for updates rather than creating new ones. Use `npm run` for auto-generated README.md files.

## Changes Log Format

Keep the changes file chronological. Add entries under **Added**, **Modified**, or **Removed** after each step completion. Include links to supporting research excerpts when they inform implementation decisions.

Changes file naming: `YYYYMMDD-task-description-changes.md` in `.copilot-tracking/changes/`. Begin each file with `<!-- markdownlint-disable-file -->`.

Changes file structure:

```markdown
<!-- markdownlint-disable-file -->
# Release Changes: {{task name}}

**Related Plan**: {{plan-file-name}}
**Implementation Date**: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}

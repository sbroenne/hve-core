# Azure DevOps Work Items Planning File Instructions

ADO Work Item Project: hve-core

<!-- <planning-folder-structure> -->
## Planning File Definitions & Directory Conventions

Root planning workspace structure:

```plain
.copilot-tracking/
  workitems/
    <planning-type>/
      <artifact-normalized-name>/
        artifact-analysis.md                    # Human-readable table + recommendations
        work-items.md                           # Human/Machine-readable plan (source of truth)
        handoff.md                              # Handoff for workitem execution (optionally references work-items.json if JSON variant produced)
        planning-log.md                         # Structured operational & state log (routinely updated sections)
```
**Normalization:**
* Lower-case, hyphenated base filename without extension (e.g. `docs/Customer Onboarding PRD.md` → `docs--customer-onboarding-prd`).
* Avoid spaces and punctuation besides hyphens (replace with hyphens).
* Choose primary artifact when multiple artifacts and documents are provided or best effort.
<!-- </planning-folder-structure> -->

## Planning File Requirements

* Planning markdown files MUST start with:
  ```
  <!-- markdownlint-disable-file -->
  <!-- markdown-table-prettify-ignore-start -->
  ```
* Planning markdown files MUST end with (before last newline):
  ```
  <!-- markdown-table-prettify-ignore-end -->
  ```

## planning-log.md

* planning-log.md is a living document: sections are routinely added, updated, extended, and removed in-place.
* Iterating on any planning files requires updates to planning-log.md in order to track progress.
* Track all new, in-progress, and completed steps for Phases routinely.
* Update Status section with in-progress review of completed and proposed steps.
* Update Previous Phase when moving onto any other Phase (not required to be in-order (meaning, Phase-1 could be repeated after Phase-2 due to discovery)).
* Update Current Phase and Previous Phase when transitioning phases.

## Work Item Fields

Track field usage explicitly so downstream automation can rely on consistent data. When discovering existing items, capture the current values for every field you plan to modify and preserve any organization-specific custom fields that already exist on the work item.

**Relative Work Item Type Fields:**
* Core: "System.Id", "System.WorkItemType", "System.Title", "System.State", "System.Reason", "System.Parent", "System.AreaPath", "System.IterationPath", "System.TeamProject", "System.Description", "System.AssignedTo", "System.CreatedBy", "System.CreatedDate", "System.ChangedBy", "System.ChangedDate", "System.CommentCount"
* Board: "System.BoardColumn", "System.BoardColumnDone", "System.BoardLane"
* Classification / Tags: "System.Tags"
* Common Extensions: "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.AcceptanceCriteria", "Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps", "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority", "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.StackRank", "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ValueArea", "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BusinessValue", "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Risk", "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.TimeCriticality", "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Severity"
* Estimation & Scheduling: "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints", "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.OriginalEstimate", "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.RemainingWork", "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.CompletedWork", "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.Effort"

**Work Item Types and Available Fields:**
| Type       | Key Fields                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Epic       | System.Title, System.Description, System.AreaPath, System.IterationPath, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BusinessValue, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ValueArea, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority, Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.Effort                                                        |
| Feature    | System.Title, System.Description, System.AreaPath, System.IterationPath, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ValueArea, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BusinessValue, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority                                                                                          |
| User Story | System.Title, System.Description, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.AcceptanceCriteria, Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ValueArea                                                                                     |
| Bug        | System.Title, Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Severity, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.StackRank, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ValueArea, Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints (optional), System.AreaPath, System.IterationPath |

Rules:
* Feature requires Epic parent.
* User Story requires Feature parent.
* Bug links are optional; add relationships when they provide helpful traceability, but do not create placeholder links just to satisfy this checklist.

## Search Keyword & Search Text Protocol

Goal: Deterministic, resumable discovery of existing work items.

<!-- <search-keyword-protocol> -->
Steps:
1. Maintain ACTIVE KEYWORD GROUPS: ordered list, each group = 1-4 specific terms (multi‑word allowed) joined by OR.
2. Compose `searchText`:
  * Single group → `(term1 OR "multi word")`
  * Multiple groups → `(group1) AND (group2)` etc.
3. Execute search (page size suggested: 50). For every related result ID:
  * Fetch full work item immediately and update planning-log.md.
  * Compute similarity (semantic intent focus, not token count).
  * Assign action via matrix.

Similarity Computation Guidance:
* Use combined semantic representation of (title + description + acceptance).
* Boost for aligned outcome/goal verbs; penalize scope or persona mismatch.
* Store raw float, round to 2 decimals for `similarity` field.
<!-- </search-keyword-protocol> -->

<!-- <similarity-decision-matrix> -->
| Similarity | Action | Interpretation                                 |
|------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| ≥ 0.70     | update | Strong alignment with existing item intent     |
| 0.50-0.69  | review | Potential alignment; needs manual confirmation |
| < 0.50     | create | No sufficiently aligned existing item          |
<!-- </similarity-decision-matrix> -->

<!-- <state-persistence-protocol> -->
## Routine State Persistence & Summarization Tool Call Protocol

* Must maintain planning-log.md routinely by keeping it up to date as information is discovered.

### Required Pre-Summarization
Summarization must also include the following (or else you will likely cause breaking changes):
* Full paths to all working files with a summary describing each file and its purpose
* Anything that was not captured into the planning-log.md file or other planning files that should have been captured before summarization
  * Specifically state exactly what needs to be done again (e.g., use the mcp_ado_wit_get_work_item tool with ID ### again, etc)
* Exact work item IDs that were already reviewed
* Exact work item IDs that are left to be reviewed
* Exact work item IDs that were already reviewed but likely not captured into the planning-log.md file or other planning files
* Exact planning steps that you were previously on (must repeat if data was not captured into planning files)
* Exact planning steps that are still required
* Any potential work item search criteria that is still required

### Required Post-Summarization Recovery
If context has `<summary>` and only one tool call, then immediately do the following protocol before any additional edits/decisions:

1. **State File Validation**:
  * It's likely you've lost valuable information and you are now required to recover your context to avoid broken changes
  * Use the `list_dir` tool under the `.copilot-tracking/workitems/<planning-type>/<artifact-normalized-name>` working folder
  * Use the `read_file` tool to read back in all of the planning-log.md to build back context

2. **Context Reconstruction User Update**:
  Let the user know that you are working on rebuilding your context:

  ```markdown
  ## Resuming After Context Summarization

  I notice our conversation history was summarized. Let me rebuild context:

  📋 **[Analyzing Title]**: [Analyze planning-log.md and current work item content]

  To ensure continuity, I'll do the following:
  * [List protocol that you plan to follow next]

  Would you like me to proceed with this approach?
  ```

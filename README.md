An open-source library of Hypervelocity Engineering components that accelerates Azure solution development by enabling advanced conversational workflows.

**Quick Install:** Automated installation via the `hve-core-installer` agent in VS Code (~30 seconds)

## Overview

HVE Core provides a unified set of optimized GitHub Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot custom agents, along with curated instructions and prompt templates, to deliver intelligent, context-aware interactions for building solutions on Azure. Whether you're tackling greenfield projects or modernizing existing systems, HVE Core reduces time-to-value and simplifies complex engineering tasks.

## Quick Start

### VS Code Extension (Simplest)

**Recommended for most users:** Install HVE Core directly from the VS Code Marketplace for zero-configuration setup:

[![Install from Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install_from_Marketplace-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core)

See [Extension Installation Guide](docs/getting-started/methods/extension.md) for details.

### Automated Custom Installation

For customization or team version control, use the `hve-core-installer` agent:

[![Install HVE Core](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install_HVE_Core-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://aka.ms/install-hve-core) [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install-24bfa5?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://aka.ms/install-hve-core-insiders)

After installing the agent:

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code (Ctrl+Alt+I)
2. Select `hve-core-installer` from the agent list
3. Enter: "Install HVE Core into my project"
4. Follow the guided installation

The installer will:

* Clone the hve-core repository as a sibling to your workspace
* Validate the repository structure
* Update your VS Code settings.json with custom agent, prompt, and instruction paths
* Make all HVE Core components immediately available

### Manual Installation

For manual setup or alternative installation methods, see the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started/README.md) which covers:

* [VS Code Extension](docs/getting-started/methods/extension.md) ⭐ - Marketplace install, zero config
* [Multi-Root Workspace](docs/getting-started/methods/multi-root.md) - Cross-environment portability
* [Submodule](docs/getting-started/methods/submodule.md) - Team version control
* [Peer Clone](docs/getting-started/methods/peer-clone.md) - Local VS Code, solo developers
* [Git-Ignored Clone](docs/getting-started/methods/git-ignored.md) - Devcontainer ephemeral setup
* [Mounted Directory](docs/getting-started/methods/mounted.md) - Advanced container sharing
* [GitHub Codespaces](docs/getting-started/methods/codespaces.md) - Cloud development

### Prerequisites

* GitHub Copilot subscription
* VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension
* Git installed and available in PATH
* Node.js and npm (for development and validation)

### Try the RPI Workflow

AI coding assistants are brilliant at simple tasks. Ask for a function that reverses a string, and you'll get working code in seconds. Ask for a feature that touches twelve files across three services, and you'll get something that looks right, compiles cleanly, and breaks everything it touches.

The root cause: AI can't tell the difference between investigating and implementing. When you ask for code, it writes code. It doesn't stop to verify that the patterns it chose match your existing modules. AI generally writes first and thinks never.

HVE Core's RPI (Research → Plan → Implement) framework solves this by separating concerns into distinct phases. When AI knows it cannot implement during research, it stops optimizing for "plausible code" and starts optimizing for "verified truth." The constraint changes the goal.

Get started with RPI:

* [Why the RPI Workflow Works](docs/rpi/why-rpi.md): the psychology behind constraint-based AI workflows
* [Your First RPI Workflow](docs/getting-started/first-workflow.md): 15-minute hands-on tutorial
* [rpi-agent](.github/agents/rpi-agent.agent.md): autonomous mode for simpler tasks that don't need strict phase separation

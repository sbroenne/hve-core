## Prerequisites

Install the VS Code Extension Manager CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

Install the PowerShell-Yaml module (required for Prepare-Extension.ps1):

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PowerShell-Yaml -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Automated CI/CD Workflows

The extension is automatically packaged and published through GitHub Actions:

| Workflow                                  | Trigger           | Purpose                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `.github/workflows/extension-package.yml` | Reusable workflow | Packages extension with flexible versioning |
| `.github/workflows/extension-publish.yml` | Release/manual    | Publishes to VS Code Marketplace            |
| `.github/workflows/main.yml`              | Push to main      | Includes extension packaging in CI          |

## Packaging the Extension

### Using the Automated Scripts (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Prepare the Extension

First, update `package.json` with discovered agents, prompts, and instructions:

```bash
# Discover components and update package.json
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Prepare-Extension.ps1

# Or use npm script
npm run extension:prepare
```

The preparation script automatically:

- Discovers and registers all chat agents from `.github/agents/`
- Discovers and registers all prompts from `.github/prompts/`
- Discovers and registers all instruction files from `.github/instructions/`
- Updates `package.json` with discovered components
- Uses existing version from `package.json` (does not modify it)

#### Step 2: Package the Extension

Then package the extension:

```bash
# Package using version from package.json
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1

# Or use npm script
npm run extension:package

# Package with specific version
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Version "1.0.3"

# Package with dev patch number (e.g., 1.0.2-dev.123)
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -DevPatchNumber "123"

# Package with version and dev patch number
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Version "1.1.0" -DevPatchNumber "456"
```

The packaging script automatically:

- Uses version from `package.json` (or specified version)
- Optionally appends dev patch number for pre-release builds
- Copies required `.github` directory
- Copies `scripts/dev-tools` directory (developer utilities)
- Packages the extension using `vsce`
- Cleans up temporary files
- Restores original `package.json` version if temporarily modified

### Manual Packaging (Legacy)

If you need to package manually:

```bash
cd extension
rm -rf .github scripts && cp -r ../.github . && mkdir -p scripts && cp -r ../scripts/dev-tools scripts/ && vsce package && rm -rf .github scripts
```

## Publishing the Extension

**Important:** Update version in `extension/package.json` before publishing.

**Setup Personal Access Token (one-time):**

Set your Azure DevOps PAT as an environment variable:

```bash
export VSCE_PAT=your-token-here
```

To get a PAT:

1. Go to <https://dev.azure.com>
2. User settings → Personal access tokens → New Token
3. Set scope to **Marketplace (Manage)**
4. Copy the token

**Publish command:**

```bash
# Publish the packaged extension (replace X.Y.Z with actual version)
vsce publish --packagePath "extension/hve-core-X.Y.Z.vsix"

# Or use the latest .vsix file
VSIX_FILE=$(ls -t extension/hve-core-*.vsix | head -1)
vsce publish --packagePath "$VSIX_FILE"
```

## What Gets Included

The `extension/.vscodeignore` file controls what gets packaged. Currently included:

- `.github/agents/**` - All custom agent definitions
- `.github/prompts/**` - All prompt templates
- `.github/instructions/**` - All instruction files
- `docs/templates/**` - Document templates used by agents (ADR, BRD, Security Plan)
- `scripts/dev-tools/**` - Developer utilities (PR reference generation)
- `package.json` - Extension manifest
- `README.md` - Extension description
- `LICENSE` - License file
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history

## Testing Locally

Install the packaged extension locally:

```bash
code --install-extension hve-core-*.vsix
```

## Version Management

### Update Version in `package.json`

1. Manually update version in `extension/package.json`
2. Run `scripts/extension/Prepare-Extension.ps1` to update agents/prompts/instructions
3. Run `scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1` to create the `.vsix` file

### Development Builds

For pre-release or CI builds, use the dev patch number:

```bash
# Creates version like 1.0.2-dev.123
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -DevPatchNumber "123"
```

This temporarily modifies the version during packaging but restores it afterward.

### Override Version at Package Time

You can override the version without modifying `package.json`:

```bash
# Package as 1.1.0 without updating package.json
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Version "1.1.0"
```

## Pre-Release Channel

The extension supports dual-channel publishing to VS Code Marketplace with separate stable and pre-release tracks.

### EVEN/ODD Versioning Strategy

| Minor Version     | Channel     | Example      | Agent Maturity Included             |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| EVEN (0, 2, 4...) | Stable      | 1.0.0, 1.2.0 | `stable` only                       |
| ODD (1, 3, 5...)  | Pre-Release | 1.1.0, 1.3.0 | `stable`, `preview`, `experimental` |

Users can switch between channels in VS Code via the "Switch to Pre-Release Version" button on the extension page.

### Pre-Release Packaging

Package for the pre-release channel with the `-PreRelease` switch:

```bash
# Package for pre-release channel (includes experimental agents)
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Version "1.1.0" -PreRelease

# Prepare with PreRelease channel filtering first
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Prepare-Extension.ps1 -Channel PreRelease
pwsh ./scripts/extension/Package-Extension.ps1 -Version "1.1.0" -PreRelease
```

The `-PreRelease` switch adds `--pre-release` to the vsce command, marking the package for the Marketplace pre-release track.

### Pre-Release Workflow

Use the manual workflow for publishing pre-releases:

1. Go to **Actions** > **Publish Pre-Release Extension**
2. Enter an ODD minor version (e.g., `1.1.0`, `1.3.0`)
3. Optionally enable dry-run to test packaging without publishing
4. Run the workflow

The workflow validates the version is ODD before proceeding.

### Agent Maturity Filtering

When packaging, agents are filtered by their `maturity` frontmatter field:

| Channel    | Included Maturity Levels            |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Stable     | `stable`                            |
| PreRelease | `stable`, `preview`, `experimental` |

See [Agent Maturity Levels](../docs/contributing/ai-artifacts-common.md#maturity-field-requirements) for contributor guidance on setting maturity levels.

## Notes

- The `.github`, `docs/templates`, and `scripts/dev-tools` folders are temporarily copied during packaging (not permanently stored)
- `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md` are copied from root during packaging and excluded from git
- Only essential extension files are included (agents, prompts, instructions, templates, dev-tools)
- Non-essential files are excluded (workflows, issue templates, agent installer, etc.)
- The root `package.json` contains development scripts for the repository
